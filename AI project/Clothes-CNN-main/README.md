# Clothes-CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for clothing classification using transfer learning with the Xception model. The model is capable of classifying different types of clothing, such as T-shirts, pants, shorts, etc.

Key Features
Transfer Learning with Xception: Leveraged the pre-trained Xception model to boost the performance of the clothing classification task.

Clothing Dataset: Trained the model on a comprehensive dataset of clothing items, ensuring diverse examples for accurate classification.

Interactive Image Upload: Users can upload images to the trained model for real-time clothing classification.

Topics Explored
Dropout: Implemented dropout layers to improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.

Early Stopping: Utilized the EarlyStopping callback to halt training when there is no improvement in validation metrics, preventing potential overfitting.

Learning Rate Optimization: Explored techniques for adjusting the learning rate during training to enhance convergence and performance.

Contents
Jupyter Notebook: A detailed notebook providing insights into the theory of deep learning, code implementation, and model training.

Trained Model: The pre-trained model ready for clothing classification.

Usage
Clone the repository,
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook CNN.ipynb
Upload an image to classify the clothing item.
Feel free to explore the notebook to understand the implementation details, experiment with dropout rates, early stopping, and observe the impact on model performance.

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Alexey Grigorev for providing valuable insights and guidance through the "Machine Learning Bootcamp" book. This project drew inspiration from the concepts presented in the book, and while it is not a 100% copy, the teachings and methodologies significantly influenced the development of the clothing classification model.
